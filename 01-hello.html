<!--
The following are some of the command for git usage, after downloading and installing Git on the computer.
Git clone https://github.com/newgroups/git.git (URL) gets you the files directly from GitHub
ls will list all the files in the folder once it has been downloaded
cd #name ex. cd git took the workplace from week1 to git.
touch filename + extension. For example, touch 01-hello.html is used to add the file to it.

git add is to keep track of the file to keep track of, like git add 01-hello.html, 
meaning it will be saved every time a commit is used. It means only the ones you might want to keep track on, not all the files.
