<!--
The following are some of the command for git usage, after downloading and installing Git on the computer.
Git clone https://github.com/newgroups/git.git (URL) gets you the files directly from GitHub
ls will list all the files in the folder once it has been downloaded
cd #name ex. cd git took the workplace from week1 to git.
touch filename + extension. For example, touch 01-hello.html is used to add the file to it.

git add is to keep track of the file to keep track of, like git add 01-hello.html, 
meaning it will be saved every time after the add is used. It means only the ones you might want to keep track on, not all the files.
git commit -m "message" //It tells what change was made when you start working on it, ensuring that information can be tracked back.

git status shows what has happened or what is going on with the local file.
git push execute the push towards github

If you want to do both add and commit at the same time, then you can use a different code:
git commit -am "message"

You can use other commands too to use
